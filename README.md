This repository contains two projects that I undertook using deep learning alogorithms.

ANN (Bank customer churn modelling):
This project undertook the publicly available customer churn data to predict the expected churn rates in the future.

Snapshot of the data:

Data Dictionary:
   1. RowNumber : int; unique row identifier
   2. CustomerID : int ; unique customer identifier
   3. Surname : string
   4. CreditScore : int
   5. Geography : int
   6. Gender : String
   7. Age : int
   8. Tenure : int
   9. Balance : int (available balance in the account)
   10. NumOfProducts : int (the number of products the cust uses like credit card, chequebook, etc.)

   13. EstimatedSalary : float
   14. Exited (dependent/predicted value): int (1: left the bank | 0: otherwise)



Convulutional Neural Networks:
This model ustilised the CNN model to accurately categorise cats and dogs
