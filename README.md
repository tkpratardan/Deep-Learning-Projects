This repository contains two projects that I undertook using deep learning alogorithms.

1. ANN (Bank customer churn modelling):
   This project undertook the publicly available customer churn data to predict the expected churn rates in the future.
   
   Snapshot of the data:

   Data Dictionary:
   RowNumber : int; unique row identifier
   CustomerID : int ; unique customer identifier
   Surname : string
   CreditScore : int
   Geography : int
   Gender : String
   Age : int
   Tenure : int 
   Balance : int (available balance in the account)
   NumOfProducts : int (the number of products the cust uses like credit card, chequebook, etc.)
   HasCrCard : int (0: does not have bank credit card | 1: has bank credit card)
   IsActiveMember : int (1: the customer uses bank services atleast once a month | 0: otherwise)
   EstimatedSalary : int
   Exited (dependent/predicted value): int (1: left the bank | 0: otherwise)
   
   
   
2. Convulutional Neural Networks:
   This model ustilised the CNN model to accurately categorise cats and dogs
